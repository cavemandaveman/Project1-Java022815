##5 Problems from Project Euler

For this weekly assignment, you will be working through a set of progressively more difficult problems from Project Euler (http://projecteuler.com).
Each problem will build upon one of the concepts covered in class. Collaboration is encouraged, and full understanding of the underlying concepts is required.

These problems will not be formally graded, but you might be asked to share your solutions with the class.
